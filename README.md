# cordova-plugin-wkwebview-inputfocusfix
Cordova plugin for fixing auto focus issue of html elements on WKWebView. 

with the latest version ("cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine": "^1.2.1"), input focus still not working on real device. So, I keep cordova-plugin-wkwebview-inputfocusfix and adapte it to work with iOS 13 (which was previously only working on iOS below 13.0.0).

> this repo is a Fork from onderceylan/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-inputfocusfix

> This plugin was introduced as a temporary fix for the input focusing issue raised on main WKWebView repositories of Apache and Ionic. As the changes are merged to the main repositories - https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine/pull/37/ and https://github.com/ionic-team/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine/pull/171, the plugin is deprecated and has no effect on fixing any focus issues anymore. 

> If you're facing issues with the input focusing, simply upgrade your wkwebview cordova plugin to it's latest version. And if your issue still exists after the upgrade, open an issue on the main wkwebview cordova repo: https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine/issues.
